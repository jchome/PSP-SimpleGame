# PSP-SimpleGame
This is a quite simple game on PSP, using Staskless python + PSP2D.

I would like to try on a some small hardware the game creation. I've started with the fantasy-console Pyxel ("Pyxel is a retro game engine for Python" - https://github.com/kitao/pyxel), but the result was too limited.

## About the content of this repo
In this reposory, you will find
* The binary file "EBOOT.PBP" (just copied from the strackless python port for PSP) ;
* The startup script "script.py" ;
* A set of files in the folder "engine". This is the game-engine I've created to provide a kind of framework, to build a RPG game (a zelda-like game) ;
* The "asset" folder contains pictures for the game - See the chapter dedicated to this part, for collision detection ;
* The "conf" filder is the description of the game: how trhe engine have to work with assets to provide a kind of game.
